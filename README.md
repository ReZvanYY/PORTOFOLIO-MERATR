## Brief
The portfolio website must be built using HTML, CSS (no CSS frameworks can be used), and Vanilla JS only.

You must select 3 assignment submissions:

- Cross Course Project
- Semester Project 1
- Exam Project 1


These assignments must have been graded.

We are aware that Project Exam 1 might still be getting marked therefore do not make any changes to your submission other than the README.md.

Before submitting this portfolio assignment, you’re expected to make improvements to each project that you’re showcasing by using the detailed feedback provided by your teachers.

These improvements should also include your self-assessment which must be mentioned in the reflection PDF document.

Now that you have new skills up your sleeves, you can adapt the old assignments to display them. Think about how your previous assignments can be enhanced by applying your newly acquired skills.


## Process
Each project teaser card must include the following:

- The project thumbnail (png or jpeg and optimized to <=200KB).
- The project title.
- The project description (a teaser of max 15-20 words).
- The GitHub project repository link.
- The project demo or live website link.
